# WareLock

## Introduction

This is my academical Python project from the fall 2015. Its main purpose was to demonstrate main features of Python 2.7 that we were using during classes.

The project was designed and created as a simple RPG game in the roguelike manner. In fact, from the player perspective, it is so simple that you might call it rather a 'skeleton' than a full-featured game. The main assumption, though, was to utilize interesting language features and mechanisms rather than to build an RPG game. Because of that, most of the solutions are not really useful when building a game. Instead, they might provide a fresh view and some inspiration.
